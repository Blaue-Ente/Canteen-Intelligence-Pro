# KitchenOS

AI-driven kitchen operations app for German restaurants, canteens, and hotels. Built as a cross-platform Expo app (iOS, Android, Web) with a small Express AI proxy.

## Architecture

- `artifacts/mobile/` — Expo Router app (KitchenOS). All UI, state, AsyncStorage persistence.
- `artifacts/api-server/` — Express server. Hosts `/api/ai/chat` (SSE stream) and `/api/ai/vision` endpoints that wrap the Replit OpenAI integration.
- `artifacts/mockup-sandbox/` — design canvas (untouched template).
- `lib/integrations-openai-ai-server` — OpenAI client used by the api-server.

## Mobile structure

- `app/(tabs)/` — Home, Lager (inventory), Karte (menu), Statistik, Mehr.
- `app/chat.tsx` — Streaming AI assistant (SSE).
- `app/scan.tsx` — Camera/library photo capture for receipts, delivery notes, dish nutrition.
- `app/recipe/[id].tsx`, `app/supplier/[id].tsx` — detail screens.
- `app/{calculator, haccp, waste, suppliers, catering, settings}.tsx` — operational tools.
- `contexts/AppContext.tsx` — single reducer over `AppState`, persisted to AsyncStorage.
- `constants/{colors,i18n,seedData}.ts` — charcoal+amber theme, DE/EN dictionary, demo data.
- `lib/ai.ts` — fetch-based SSE client (uses `expo/fetch`).

## AI

- Model: `gpt-5.4`, `max_completion_tokens` only (no `temperature`).
- Chat: streamed via SSE (`data: {"content": "..."}\n\n`).
- Vision: chat-completions with `image_url: data:image/jpeg;base64,...`.
- System prompt is built per request from current low-stock items + recipe list, locale-aware.

## Persistence

- AsyncStorage key `kitchenos.state.v1`. Reducer hydrates on mount and persists on every state change.
- Hydration merge respects explicit empty arrays (only falls back to seed when a top-level key is `undefined`).

## Theme

- Charcoal + amber (`#0a0a0b` / `#f59e0b`) with full light/dark palettes (system-controlled).
- Inter font family loaded via `@expo-google-fonts/inter`.

## i18n

- DE (default) / EN, switched in Settings.
- Strings in `constants/i18n.ts`; `useT()` hook in `AppContext`.

## Server

- `routes/ai.ts` mounted from `routes/index.ts`.
- `express.json({ limit: "50mb" })` to accept base64 image payloads.
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/ai/chat` — SSE streaming chat completions.
  - `POST /api/ai/vision` — chat completion with image_url for OCR/nutrition.
  - `POST /api/ai/json` — JSON-mode completion (response_format: json_object). Used by the receipt parser and weekly menu generator.

## Phase 2 features

- **AI menu generator** — `Generieren` button on Karte calls `/api/ai/json`, returns 7 days × recipe IDs balanced for vegan/meat rotation and prioritising low-stock ingredients, then dispatches `setMenu` per day.
- **Receipt → Inventory import** — `/scan` in `Rechnung`/`Lieferschein` mode parses the photo into structured items and offers a checklist; selected items are imported with `addInventory` and the user is redirected to Lager.
- **Voice chat** — `lib/voice.ts` wraps the Web Speech API (web only). The mic button in `/chat` records, auto-fills the input on partials, and auto-sends on final transcript. A `Vorlesen` toggle uses `SpeechSynthesis` to read assistant replies aloud; per-message replay icon also available. Native gracefully shows an info alert.
- **Daily sales entry** — `/sales` screen with a 5-day strip, today's menu (or top 6 recipes) listed with `+/-` Gekocht/Verkauft steppers, live revenue total, batch-saves via `addSale`.
